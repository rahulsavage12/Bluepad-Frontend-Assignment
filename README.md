# Bluepad-Frontend-Assignment
In this assignment, I designed a flutter application with two screens: one for authentication and another for displaying an infinite scroll of images with pagination of 10 at a time to users. I utilised shared preferences to save the user's username and password so he wouldn't have to log in again the next time he opened the programme. The home page has an Appbar with a title and a logout button, as well as a card that displays the user credentials. The photographs are fetched via api from https://picsum.photos/ and loaded ten at a time using listview builder.
